### Hi there, I'm JetsadaWijit 👋

I maintain projects on both [`GitHub`](https://github.com/JetsadaWijit) and [`GitLab`](https://gitlab.com/JetsadaWijit).

I manage my projects using a **modular organization architecture**.  
A prime example is [`MCEngine`](https://github.com/MCEngine), which serves as a "core" organization for main plugins.

I then create separate satellite organizations to host extensions for a specific main plugin.
For example, [`MCClauneck`](https://github.com/MCClauneck) is created specifically to host extensions for [`MCEconomy`](https://github.com/MCEngine/mceconomy).

**Why I structure projects this way:**
* **Modularity:** Features can be "plugged" in or out seamlessly without bloating or breaking the core function.
* **Community Friendly:** It allows other developers to build their own extensions on top of my core plugins without needing to modify the base code.
* **Flexibility:** It empowers server owners to mix and match exactly which extensions they want to use.

**Tech Stack:**
* **Languages:** JavaScript, Java, Python
* **Frameworks:** ExpressJS, FastAPI
* **Databases:** SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB
* **Tools:** GitHub, GitLab, CI/CD, Docker
* **AI:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok
